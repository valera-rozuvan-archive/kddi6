Retro WYSIWYG HTML editor


About
-----

This is going to slowly become a state-of-the-art proof of concept WYSIWYG retro editor. Let me explain what all those
big words really mean.

- slowly: I am working on this project when time permits
- state-of-the-art: all the latest and greatest JavaScript + Node.js technologies will be used
- proof of concept: I dreamed up this editing system for HTML documents while walking through the woods, so I am doing
this to see if my ideas will actually work
- WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get editor - means that you don't write any markup to produce HTML documents
- retro: the editor will have a feeling as if it is from the days of the console; *nix users will feel right at home = )
